A student engagement monitoring app created as part of a cloud computing module at university. This application consists of a range of microservices written in different languages incorporating java with spring boot, php and python.
The frontend includes html, minimal css and Javascript to enable functionality. Initially hosted on university's private cloud. All containerised microservices using Docker and Kubernetes. This application worked really well and
was very enjoyable to work on. An excellent learning experience.
